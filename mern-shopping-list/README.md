Built a full stack application with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along side the Traversy Media YouTube tutorial. The app:

- implements Redux for state management and
- implements Reactstrap and React Transitions
- includes user registration and login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- is deployed to Heroku: [Link to Live App](https://damp-island-77423.herokuapp.com/)
